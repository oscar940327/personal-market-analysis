## Overview

An end-to-end trading signal system for US equities that ingests price data, extracts sentiment from financial news using both LLM (DeepSeek V3) and FinBERT, runs multiple backtesting strategies, and generates daily HTML reports delivered via email.

The system was built to rigorously test whether **LLM-based sentiment signals improve a technical-analysis baseline**, and whether **regime-aware position sizing** reduces drawdown effectively. Both hypotheses were validated through a **4-year cross-bear-market backtest** on 14 large-cap US stocks.

**Key technical choices:**
- **Hybrid sentiment engine**: FinBERT for deterministic historical backfill, LLM for daily reports with human-readable reasoning
- **Three comparison strategies**: Pure technical baseline (4a), sentiment-filtered (4b), regime-aware sizer (4c)
- **Cross-bear validation**: Tested across 2022 bear market (SPY -25%) to avoid survivorship bias in bull-only data

## Key Findings

Three empirical findings drove major design pivots during development. Each finding represents a falsified hypothesis.

![4-Year Cross-Bear-Market Comparison](docs/images/returns_comparison.png)

### 1. LLM sentiment filtering hurts more than it helps

A 4-year backtest across 14 stocks showed that adding LLM sentiment as an entry filter **reduced average returns by 37.65%** compared to the pure technical baseline. The "sentiment threshold" approach was abandoned in favor of "emergency-only" sentiment usage.

| Strategy | Avg Return (4y) | Beats Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| 4a Baseline (pure technical) | **+114.48%** | — |
| 4b + Sentiment filter | +76.83% | 4 / 14 |
| 4c + Regime sizer | +53.07% | 2 / 14 |

### 2. Regime sizing reduces drawdown but sacrifices returns

![Return vs Drawdown Trade-off](docs/images/return_vs_drawdown.png)

The market-regime-based position sizer (80% bull / 50% neutral / 20% bear) **reduced average max drawdown by 10.74 percentage points**, but at the cost of 61% lower cumulative returns. The regime system is slow to scale back up during bear-to-bull transitions, missing rebound rallies.

| Strategy | Max Drawdown | Avg Return |
|---|---|---|
| 4a Baseline | -34.26% | +114.48% |
| 4c + Regime sizer | **-23.53%** | +53.07% |

### 3. LLM sentiment scoring is non-deterministic

This finding was accidental. While debugging a different issue, I re-ran the exact same backfill twice — same model, same `temperature=0.1`, same news data, same prompts — and got average backtest returns differing by **3.61%** (one run gave +60%, the other +56%). Individual ticker results varied by up to 20%.

The implication was uncomfortable: if identical runs produce different backtest results, then any "improvement" from LLM sentiment over baseline might be noise rather than signal. This invalidated several earlier experiments and forced a redesign.

The resolution was a **hybrid engine**: FinBERT (deterministic, free, 100% reproducible) is used for the 4-year historical backfill where reasoning text is irrelevant, while LLM is retained for daily reports where human-readable reasoning helps the end user interpret signals.

### Cross-Bear-Market Comparison (2022-01 to 2026-04, 14 stocks)

| Ticker | 4a Baseline | 4b +Sent | 4c +Regime | Buy & Hold |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| TSLA | +72.65% | +26.98% | +39.56% | -12.75% |

| AVGO | +112.14% | +52.33% | +49.50% | +460.14% |
| CRWD | +10.05% | -15.98% | -14.66% | +91.11% |
| **Average** | **+114.48%** | +76.83% | +53.07% | +371.44% |

### Interpretation

- **TSLA case study**: Over the 4-year window, buy-and-hold produced **-12.75%** while the technical baseline produced **+72.65%** — demonstrating that the system adds value in bearish conditions.
- **4c regime sizer trade-off**: While it reduces average max drawdown from -34.26% to -23.53% (-10.74pp improvement), it underperforms on returns because it scales down position size during the bear-to-bull transition, missing rebound rallies.
- **4a baseline selection**: Based on 14-stock cross-bear results, the production system uses 4a baseline with sentiment-only-for-emergency-exit. This matches the findings of Liu et al. (2025) in [FINSABER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078), which noted that LLM-based strategies deteriorate under robust long-term testing.

## Design Decisions

A selection of non-obvious engineering decisions.

1. **Hybrid sentiment engine (FinBERT + LLM)** — FinBERT was chosen for historical backfill after discovering LLM non-determinism (3.61% result variance between identical runs). LLM is retained for daily reports to preserve human-readable reasoning.

2. **Cross-bear-market testing** — Bull-only backtesting was rejected because the FINSABER paper (Liu et al., 2025) demonstrated that LLM strategies deteriorate under robust testing. 2022 data was backfilled specifically to include a bear market regime.

3. **Multi-dimensional news search rolled back** — An earlier version of the news fetcher split searches across 5 structured dimensions (earnings / analyst opinion / risk events / industry / latest) and used round-robin selection to feed the LLM. The intuition was that structured inputs would yield better sentiment signals than a single generic query. The intuition was wrong. A direct comparison showed the multi-dimensional version produced **-3.46% lower average returns** than the single-query version on the same watchlist. After some analysis, the likely cause is that round-robin selection dilutes extreme signals — a day with one earnings beat and four neutral stories gets averaged into a weaker signal than a single query would capture. The simpler approach was restored and the multi-dimensional branch was abandoned.

4. **Regime sizer kept as experimental, not production** — Despite reducing drawdown by 10.74 percentage points, 4c underperforms on cumulative returns in 12 of 14 stocks. The production system uses 4a baseline with sentiment-emergency-exit only.

5. **SQLite for storage** — Chosen over PostgreSQL because this is a single-user system with modest data volume (~30k rows). Zero operational overhead; all data is in one file.

## Future Work

**Walk-forward validation** is the most important outstanding item. The current 4-year backtest uses the entire window as a single test period. A proper walk-forward protocol would split the data into a training window (e.g., 2022-2024) for strategy selection and parameter tuning, then evaluate on a held-out window (2025-2026) to measure whether the chosen configuration generalizes out-of-sample.

This matters because the current production choice (4a baseline) was made after observing results on the full window — which introduces a mild form of lookahead. A walk-forward test would either validate this choice or surface that some other configuration performs better under stricter methodology. The FINSABER paper (Liu et al., 2025) demonstrates that many LLM-based strategies collapse under this kind of stricter testing, so applying the same protocol here would be a natural next step.
